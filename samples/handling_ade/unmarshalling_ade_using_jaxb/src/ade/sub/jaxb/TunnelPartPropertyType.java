/**
 * Denotes the relation of an _AbstractTunnel to its parts. The gml:AssociationType attribute group for enabling the use of refs is not repeated in the
 * 				restriction and thus omitted. The building part has to be given inline, i.e. explicitely in this property. The reason for this inline definition is that no
 * 				BuildingPart is used by more than one building, thus the use or references to building parts defined elsewhere is prohibited.
